# Epigenetic and transcriptomic differences between hysteresis and non-hysteresis EMT to unveil stem cell gene programs at single-cell resolution

R code and gene lists used for the single-cell multiome data analysis in hysteretic vs non-hysteretic EMT cells at single-cell resolution. 

The gene lists and signatures used in this project are found in the file named **signature_lists.xlsx**. Moreover, the metaprograms used can be found in **meta_programs.xlsx**. 

In the **sc_code.R**, we can find the code used for the majority of the project, except the cluster refining, which can be found in **cluster_validation_Mut.R** (mutant condition) and **cluster_validation_WT.R** (wild-type condition).
